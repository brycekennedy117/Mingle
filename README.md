Mingle Project
===================================

Mingle is an online dating matchmaker site that suggests potential matches based on their compatibility with the user. It enables user to interact with other users via a messaging functionality. Mingle allows users to create a profile so that other users can see and express their interest by liking or disliking the profile. The application also use an algorithm to that the user has set and use it to calculate their potential matches. It allows users to select sort other users profile by sorting its age and distance. The application is designed with simplicity in mind so that users will have an easy, stress free experience in trying to find a potential partner.

Users will need to have a valid email address to sign up. While signing up, users will be asked a series of simple questions that will be used to identify the user as well as their self assessment of their traits to help in finding the right match for the user. Users will be able to select and update their details and pictures at anytime. The dashboard page will list all the other users that can be narrowed down by using the age and location filters. Users are able to select "like" the profiles that they like or "dislike" if they don't think the suggestion is the correct match. Messaging functionality is available for users to be able to communicate with their interest to set up a date.
